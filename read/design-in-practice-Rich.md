AMAZING talk about designing solutions. Very pratical and concrete examples.

Care about the words, they are important. "Choose good words, all the time"

Write Questions and Answer them during the process

Draw decision matrices, illustrate the tradeoffs.

Well define the problem you are trying to solve. "Succinct statement of unmet user objectives and cause(s)"

There must be always more than one solution.

"but don't build something on the same day you think of it"
