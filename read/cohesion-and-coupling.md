# CPS211 Lecture: Cohesion and Coupling; the MVC Paradigm

## Cohesion
When an entity is cohesitive it performs a **single and well-defined** task.

*our primary focus for entity is classes, but it can be applied to lower (methods) ou higher (packages) levels* 

> can I describe the purpose of this entity (class, method, etc.) in a short statement without using words like ‘and’?

## Coupling
We want to remove all unnecessary dependencies in order to make modification/mantenance easier

when you reference to types of other entities this is also coupling
