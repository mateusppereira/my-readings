# Why Over-Reusing is Bad

> Why do we want to reuse stuff? Because we want to be able to change fast 

__Now here comes the paradox__

> by reusing code that has been already written we are able to save some coding time but everything that is shared inherently becomes itself harder to change

### Conclusion
> In case we need to reuse something then the best thing we can do is to make the boundaries of our code and the reused code as clear as possible

> reuse on the wrong level of granularity or forcefully trying to reuse everything that looks similar at first sight can be much more harmful than duplication
