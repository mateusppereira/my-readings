# Kind Engineering

> Kind is about being invested in other people, figuring out how to help them, meeting them where they are.

We need to be honest in order to build trust.

Challenge people directly but care personally

> White lies aren’t evil but they don’t help people grow

## Honest

> For example, if someone’s leading a meeting and trying to persuade the room to adopt a new architecture but it doesn’t go well, the unkind thing to do for them there is lie and say “good job in the meeting!”

We won't help others by not being honest.

Instead of lying to create a fake nice environment, observe what went well and what could be improved and share with them.

## Async comms

Understand the WHY when doing code reviews. 

Don't spam the PR with comments. Sync with the author and go deeper on the context. 

You should not work as a linter. If you are doing so, it's a clear sign of bad tooling.

Be clear about comments that doesn't require any change or response. 

## Psychological Safety

Ask for feedback. Negative ones.

### Be Inclusive

> Give people a voice by letting them express themselves in whatever format they feel is right

### No Blame

> every “failure” or incident should be celebrated as an opportunity to grow and learn

## Receiving Feedback

> listen, understand and then Thank the person for the feedback

> don’t react in the moment
