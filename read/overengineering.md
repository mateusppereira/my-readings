# Modern Software Over-Engineering Mistakes

## Engineers think we’re the smartest people around
Don't plan for 100 thigs, business will always come up with 101st thing you never tought

## Prefer Isolating Actions than Combining
Don't try to imagine abstractions ahead of time

## Instead of trying to solve the business problem, we waste our time trying to find the perfect abstractions
Write code that is easy to delete, not easy to extend

Duplication is better than the wrong abstraction

Because only when we see many parts of the system share “similar” code, a better shared abstraction emerges

## Reuse. Fork. Contribute. Reconsider
In house inventions costs more on long term
